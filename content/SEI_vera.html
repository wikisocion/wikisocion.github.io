<h3>1st Function - Si Si Introverted sensing<a class="headerlink" href="#st-function-si-si-introverted-sensing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Beauty and harmony in all their manifestations, a bright life full of positive impressions, tendency towards enjoyment in its most sophisticated forms - these form base values of representatives of the type SEI (ISFp). People of this type are characterized not only by creation of that which is beautiful in various forms and representations, but also by a tendency towards preservation of the already existing artifacts.</p>
<p>The ISFp loves and appreciates life. For people of this type, it is very important to have a taste for life. It is important to make life beautiful, light, and enjoyable; it’s important to perceive “life as a celebration”. Providing for someone’s happiness and enjoyment for the SEI is just as enjoyable as being on the receiving end of it. For this same reason the SEI tries to not create any troubles for others. He enjoys his life and does not intend to complicate it for anyone else. The SEI typically won’t permit himself to ruin somebody’s mood, or to introduce into a party notes of mundanity. He is devoted to all that brings contentment and satisfaction.</p>
<p>The ISFp is a realist (otherwise, how could he complement such an intuitive “dreamer” as ENTp, Don Quixote?). People of this type are typically oriented at the very basic and natural values of life: the well-bring and prosperity of their family, keeping a livable home, maintaining good relations with others.</p>
<p>Good mood, balanced state of mind, sense of well-being within his soul, mind, and body - are all important for the SEI. The lack of any of these conditions seriously perturbs him. For example, if circumstances fold such that the SEI is unable to eat out on lunch breaks, and instead is forced to eat junk food on regular basis, this will dismay him: “It’s easy to get gastritis like this …”</p>
<p>Well-being - and lack of thereof, happiness - and misfortune, health - and sickness, life - and death - these are the main topics of SEI’s ruminations. The SEI likes to reflect and think about the conditions in which he would like to live, study, or travel. The SEI also likes to criticize poorly thought out or inconveniently organized conditions for work, education, and leisure.</p>
<p>The ISFp is able to remember and recreate once experienced sensations, often to high level of detail. Sounds, colors, smells the ISFp remembers as one complete wholesome impression that can then evoke in ISFp’s memory associations tied to some feeling, reminiscent of some event, some person, or some relationship.</p>
<p>The ISFp can notice unpleasant sensations experienced by other people. For example, a person of this type may immediately take note if someone is too hot, too cold, not getting enough fresh air, of wearing shoes that are too tight. The ISFp notices when someone is experiencing painful sensations and usually can see what is causing them. The ISFp then tries to remove the cause of the problem. He or she does so in a delicate and tactful manner, since the ISFp considers sensations to be especially personal and intimate – therefore, the influence must be delicate and unobtrusive. (Representatives of this type work well in medical occupations.)</p>
<p>The ISFp is able to empathize with another person not feeling well, since his or her own low mood or poor state is a cause for great concern. In such instances, the ISFp becomes completely absorbed by own condition and the sensations. Having to interact with other people during these periods only irritates him, especially if others are indifferent to his state and don’t show sympathy or care. Insufficiently expressed compassion the ISFp interprets as a sign of heartless callousness and poor relation to himself. If, for example, he sees that his complaints only irritate people around him, he tries to limit his contact with them until better times.</p>
<p>Formally expressed sympathies, as well as generally encouraging, conventional statements do not improve ISFp’s condition by one bit. If the ISFp is feeling down or has fallen sick, he or she needs not encouragement, but comforting.</p>
<p>The ISFp does not see himself fit for physical overloads, therefore, he does not like finding himself in conditions that require exceptional physical endurance from him, especially if this in his leisure time. He likes to relax in conditions of modest and unpretentious comfort in the company of pleasant and interesting people. Tourism that requires high physical exertion, with an element of risk or danger, as well as the absence of basic amenities, is comparatively of little interest to him.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Editor’s note: This description is not entirely accurate. Some ISFps do engage in sports in school and take them up later in life, and some even become professional athletes, since sensing is still in the area of confidence for people of this type.</p>
</div>
<p>The ISFp likes to spend his leisure time out in nature, for he or she keenly feels its beauty. And any instances of beauty the ISFp tries to remember, as in general he tries to remember everything good, so that he’ll “have something to recollect later”. (“Life is not what has been lived, but what has been remembered.”)</p>
<p>The ISFp likes to receive guests. He/she is glad to have an opportunity to demonstrate good taste and culinary talents. The process of preparing to receive guests itself is of enjoyment to ISFp. The ISFp usually prepares an entire “sensory celebration” for his or her visitors: a welcoming atmosphere, nice music, soft lighting, beautiful silverware, savory food - everything is set up so that the enjoyment from the dinner or celebration is all-inclusive and most fulfilling.</p>
<p>The ISFp thoroughly thinks over all of the details of upcoming dinner or social get-together: the list of guests, the design of the table, the combination of dishes, the choice of wine. If, for example, it is a New Year holiday, the ISFp will think over the arrangement of the rooms, carnival costumes, gifts, surprises … The ISFp gets very upset even angry if someone interferes with the realization of his/her holiday plans: “Imagine this: I’m bringing up a cake with candles upstairs, and my mother-in-law turns on the lights! How does she not understand that by doing this she has ruined the mood … And then she started giving out gifts! … She does not understand that these gifts are not from her, but from Santa Claus - and have to be found under the fir tree. This way she has spoiled the holiday for the children!”</p>
<p>The ISFp is usually confident and has a good taste in everything that concerns harmony of sensations. The ISFps make for unsurpassed culinary specialists, capable of determining the gustatory qualities of food and the degree of its readiness simply by the smell. The ISFp does not simply prepare the food: he creates it, puts his heart and soul into it, imagining what kind of pleasure the food will bring to others.</p>
<p>The ISFp usually has a serious approach to the subject of nutrition, and is very discerning and fastidious in matters that concern food. The ISFp will not eat food that does not evoke trust in him, no matter how much he’s asked to do it. People of this type tend to be rather conservative in matters of their taste.</p>
<p>Under any conditions the ISFp knows how to create the feeling of warmth and coziness. Whatever modest means the ISFp has available, he will always devise a way to decorate his home. The SEI may use his own artwork or handiwork, his own drawings or pictures of his children for this. Any even temporary SEI’s living quarters feel comfortable and settled.</p>
<p>In design of the interior, the ISFp prefers an intricate-elegant style, frequently with decorative additions. The SEI uses space very efficiently, and knows how to make even the smallest area comforting.</p>
<p>Order in the house of SEI (especially if in a dual relationship) is usually maintained in a very non-intrusive and burdenless form for the inhabitants: they scatter the things and the ISFp patiently collects them and sorts them in their places, until other members of the household start to habitually put things in their places. If the ISFp does not have sufficient strength to impose order on a regular basis on the entire house, then there nonetheless will always be some area where order will be strictly maintained and where everything will be organized and tastefully arranged.</p>
<p>The objects in ISFp’s household are always beautiful and convenient, always very beautiful dishware. Not only the holiday set, but also the one for everyday use. Beautiful dishes and beautiful bed linen - are “small weakness” of representatives of this type. Soft, convenient furniture, carpets, pillows, napkins - everything which gladdens the eye and predisposes to relaxation without fail is present in the house of SEI.</p>
<p>The aesthetics of ISFp is designed to be perceived in small portions and in small forms. The beauty of each thing must be perceived individually - hence the presence of certain decorative over-saturation that is characteristic of ISFp’s sense of aesthetics. (This is characteristic of the aesthetics of all irrational sensing-ethical types - ISFps and ESFps.)</p>
<p>Some ISFps possess artistic talents, which they with pleasure put to realization. Thus, without being trained specifically for the profession of a barber or a hairdresser, the ISFp often does this work no worse, but at times even better than a professional. It difficult to compete with an ISFp who professionally takes up design (clothing, hair-dos, foot-wear, furniture, and so on).</p>
<p>The SEI astutely feels the harmony of color, lines, forms, sounds, and odors. Representatives of this type make for excellent perfumers and tasters. The ISFp knows how to select complimentary combinations of smell and color, color and sound. They can, for example, invent a perfume that would correspond to a specific music, mood, color combination, a specific artistic direction, or style of clothing.</p>
<p>The ISFp is able to create own fashion, as well as adapt to already existing directions in fashion. The ISFp will never wear what is inconvenient to wear, or that which disadvantageously emphasizes deficiencies in his or her appearance. This explains a certain talent of SEI to appear exceptionally attractive in any clothing. By nature some ISFps are inclined to fullness, but they manage this problem magnificently well due to their ability to dress tastefully, and to easily move around and feel themselves comfortable under any conditions. Besides, the ISFp cannot allow weight to cause any inconvenience. Therefore, the SEI begins dieting any time that he or she feels it is necessary.</p>
<p>The ISFp is always confident in own attractiveness, and the people around them, especially representatives of opposite sex, also feel this. SEIs usually enjoy success, moreover, success that has been well deserved, and this greatly gladdens them. The ISFps never speculates on own beauty, since he/she considers it a normal and natural occurrence. The ISFp feels glad to bring pleasure to others by his or her own appearance. Moreover, the ISFp willingly helps by advice and by action anyone who is interested in making their appearance more attractive, by which the SEI renders an invaluable service to his or her dual, ILE “Don Quixote”, who usually does not give sufficient attention to own exterior appearance. (As one student of type ISFp remembered of her ENTp professor: “Each time I saw him, I so much wanted to wash him clean!..”)</p>
<p>There is nothing more natural for the ISFp than to care for his or her loved ones and for the members of his or her family - this is one of primary and vital values of the SEI. The members of SEI’s household are always fed, cared, and provided for. The ISFp can minimize his own needs, but he will always strive that family would not experience even the smallest of inconveniences.</p>
<p>The ISFp considers the aesthetic education of children to be a matter of great importance. For example, even living on unemployment payouts he may purchase a piano for his children and pay for their music lessons.</p>

<div class="section" id="nd-function-fe-extraverted-ethics">
<h3>2nd Function - Fe Extraverted ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#nd-function-fe-extraverted-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In terms of emotions, the ISFp often produces a two-way impression: outwardly - this is a lighthearted jovial merry person and an optimist, internally - a person who seems restrained and strained.</p>
<p>In an unfamiliar social group, the ISFp tries not to attract special attention and observes more than he acts. Outwardly the ISFp always seems calm, balanced, and confident in himself. With the apparent openness, internally he always seems reserved and distrustful. Frequently makes an impression of a person who is “on his own mind”. And indeed, the ISFp fears to make a slip of the tongue and mention anything in excess.</p>
<p>At close distance, among familiar people, the ISFp communicates easily and freely; he or she knows how to create an informal and uninhibited situation. The SEI loves to entertain his or her friends by telling funny and amusing histories that spark their interest.</p>
<p>The ISFp knows how to and loves to be the soul of a company. He can wonderfully well raise the mood by telling anecdotes and jokes. If some jokes are received as being inappropriate, the SEI can also quickly and tactfully change the topic and direct the attention elsewhere. It must be noted that the ISFp maintains good mood in his group only in cases when this doesn’t contradict his own internal state.</p>
<p>The ISFp is usually friendly, not prone to pick arguments and conflicts. He positively predisposes other people to himself, can make a personal contact with any person in his surroundings, and knows how to create feelings of warmth and cordiality. The SEI feels his conversation partners wonderfully well, knows how to emotionally tune to them, moreover, he does this completely sincerely. The wins the trust and confidence of people easily, and rarely misuses it (if only this is not required by the interests of its work).</p>
<p>The ISFp encourages his conversation partners to frankness and sincerity. (This is one quality which makes it possible for representatives of this type to make great intelligence officers, agents, psychotherapists, and educators.)</p>
<p>The ISFp is able to memorize and to reproduce the once experienced emotions, can empathize with a person and imagine what they must be going though, his feeling and his character. The SEI knows how to emotionally recreate and experience inside himself the emotional state of another person, as if passing the other person through himself or herself. (Due to this quality, ISFps can become very good actors, diplomats, and mediators.)</p>
<p>In case a serious quarrel or dispute starts, the ISFp tries to discharge situation, distract the people who are arguing or calm them down. (This trait is oriented at the problematic ethical aspects of his dual, ENTp “Don Quixote”, who frequently gets stuck in arguments, which turn into quarrels.) Of course, the ISFp himself can get pulled into the quarrel with the conflicting side, but nevertheless the state of hostility is ultimately unpleasant for him or her. For this very reason, the SEI prefers to act as the connecting link between the opposing parties (“the master of shuttle diplomacy”). The SEI is always is glad to have an opportunity to reconcile, to persuade, and to convince someone. The SEI is adept at arranging or settling his/her matters by unofficial means.</p>
<p>Working in a position of supervisor or manager, the ISFp tries to maintain good relations with all of his or her employees. He considers it important to pay attention to the personal and psychological climate of the working group.</p>
<p>The ISFp tries to criticize others less - he/she does not like to conflict and to acquire enemies. Therefore, even if it is necessary to criticize someone, the SEI tries to do this in a soft form. If the SEI sees that this antagonizes or traumatizes someone too much, he will step back, try to not aggravate relations, and turn everything into a joke. (This quality is absolutely necessary in personal contact with this dual, ILE “Don Quixote”, who, as has already been mentioned, receives any criticism in his address extremely sensitively and acutely.)</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Editor’s note: Often if ISFps want to criticize someone, they will do so through Fe rather than with logic, which are weak aspects for people of this type: they will make personal comments about their character, their relationships, or their actions, playfully teasing them, coming up with nicknames, creating funny caricatures of them, sometimes crossing the line and irreverently ridiculing and a person, as if inspiring them to change for the better, but they will step down if anyone gets too angry with them. Needless to say, not everybody reacts well to this Fe form of teasing, but these emotional contrasts are invigorating to their duals.</p>
</div>
<p>The ISFp knows how to be the director of moods: if he considers it necessary to support someone, to justify how they feel, to calm them down or comfort them, he/she will do this magnificently well.</p>
<p>If the ISFp considers it necessary to draw attention to his or her own problems, he/she will do accomplish this “creatively”: the ISFp will create the situation of the completely intolerable stress and won’t “let go” until the problem start getting resolved, at least partially, or until he himself calms down. The ISFps don’t feel ashamed to openly talk about their problems, moreover, in this the SEI does not always limit himself to a close circle of friends, due to which people of this type can sometimes produce the impression of complaining too much. (This ethical “tactic” is oriented at the ethics of emotions, Fe, of SEI’s dual, ILE, who sometimes needs to be distracted from his fantastical projects and put before concrete facts and problems.)</p>

<h3>3rd Function - Ni Introverted intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#rd-function-ni-introverted-intuition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ISFp usually values his own time and the time of strangers, but he spends only as much of it as is required for achieving the result that he needed. For example, if the ISFp did not understand something or find out what he wanted to find, he will continue the conversation until he gets full clarity, regardless of the fact whether his conversation partner has or hasn’t gotten any time to talk. The SEI can pay a visit “for a minute” and get stuck for a few hours, but he will obtain complete information on all question of interest to him.</p>
<p>Such quality as punctuality is more important to the ISFp from the ethical and personal point of view. Thus, if it turns out that the ISFp has to be late, he/she will always feel very uncomfortable about this. If circumstances do not require him to be punctual, the SEI is only glad.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Editor’s note: Ni for ISFp is located in the Super-Ego block of “musts” and “shoulds”, therefore people of this type typically try to keep up with schedules and deadlines created for them by their environment, but they don’t feel easy about this especially when they can’t fully meet them.</p>
</div>
<p>A precise and clear-cut daily schedule is inconvenient for the ISFp for many reasons. The need to live according to an exact schedule, to have to be somewhere at a specific hour, often feels burdensome for people of this type. The SEI cannot always plan out his time for entertainment and relaxation and his time for work. The time he spends relaxing is determined by his current state and mood. For instance, if the circumstances allow for this, the SEI may leave and take a break himself without waiting for the official break time at his workplace. The time to stop working for the ISFp is determined by the outcome or result of his work rather than specific hours.</p>
<p>Most of ISFp’s time gets spent on attending to immediate matters, immediate needs and concerns, which especially hampers his planning. For this reason ISFp dislikes giving promises: he’s afraid he won’t be able to fulfill them due to some unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>The ISFp frequently plays the role of an optimist who is confident in tomorrow. Likes to make prognoses for the future, although his forecasts are at times too naive and simple in their nature. For example, the SEI may consider a random lucky event to be a forerunner of some future bright prospects.</p>
<p>On the aspect of “intuition of time”, Ni, abrupt changes from optimism to pessimism are especially characteristic of SEI. Sometimes a small random event he may treat as a long-term prospect: for example, if one day the ISFp was praised at work, he already envisions an outstanding career for himself, but if another day he was scolded or criticized - he assumes he will get fired in the future.</p>
<p>His own future, the future of his family, his country, his society - are topics which constantly worry the ISFp. Moreover, the ISFp cannot offer any concrete program on this aspect. Questions of the type “What with happen with me? What will happen with us?” seem to remain unresolved for the SEI and after often a topic of his or her reflections. Agonizing reflections. (An example are movies of Eldar Ryazanov Promised Heaven and Prediction.)</p>
<p>For the ISFp it is difficult to see the development of a situation in time. The SEI may thus lose a lot of time on unjustified expectations. He/she may become fixated on expectation, while turning down other viable possibilities and prospects. This is explained by the fact that the ISFp measures and justifies expenditure of time by some concrete result or outcome of the matter. If positive results are achieved, then the SEI does not regret the time spent on it.</p>
<p>ISFp’s dual the ENTp (ILE) provides him with the most valuable service in foreseeing and evaluating the future prospects. It is difficult to find a better “predictor” of global changes in society’s progress than the ENTp. No one better than the ENTp can answer the question under what conditions an individual person, family, or society as a whole will live after a specific interval of time. What changes are possible in the future, what circumstances will influence those changes.</p>
<p>The ISFp does not need to visit a fortune teller having such a dual as ENTp, who sees not only changes for better or for worse, but also sees the times for these changes. With an ENTp near by the ISFp doesn’t waste time in useless expectations - the ENTp simply won’t allow for this to happen, and will re-orient the ISFp to other promising long-term plans.</p>

<h3>4th Function - Te Te Extraverted logic<a class="headerlink" href="#th-function-te-te-extraverted-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At any upcoming work, even one that is loved, even one that is habitual and constant, the ISFp looks as some burdensome necessity - and this is one of the most serious problems of people of this type. Even if the ISFp easily and quickly completed a part of work, on the wave of a creative impulse, under the effect of inspiration, nevertheless, he or she will still have to finish it, to work through all the details, to check the end result, and all of this - is already a dreaded necessity.</p>
<p>The need to do some work puts the ISFp out of the naturally relaxed state. The need to leave this state and to switch to working regime already strains the SEI and creates discomfort in his soul: “I will finish drinking coffee now … I will finish smoking this cigarette… and then it is necessary to go and finish the project … Who could imagine how much I don’t want to do this … who would do it for me … “</p>
<p>The ISFp frequently indicates the need for take care of some matters and how he/she does not want to do them. Frequently the ISFp complains about work overloads, about lack of time. He can create an entire problem out of some usual, minor, everyday matter, and by this put stress on himself and on the people around him**. Often an impression is created that the SEI works more than anyone else, that his life is more difficult and burdensome than the life of anyone else.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Translator’s note: It happens that the SEI would rather recruit other people to partially or even fully do the work for him or her, often turning for this kind of help to family members. Creating fuss over some minor problem is one method of drawing attention of nearby people to his problems, so that they would offer their help and join in the work that he or she has planned, and then he doesn’t have to do everything on his own and can spare own efforts.</p>
</div>
<p>For ISFp it is always a struggle to enter into a working regime. It takes the ISFp a long while to “warm up” to it. It may seem to him that the work is greater than what he can do, that he doesn’t know how to accomplish it, that he doesn’t have enough resources and sufficient materials, or that his workplace is not sufficiently ready.</p>
<p>Under the influence of a creative impulse, the ISFp can accomplish his work and not even notice it. Once an idea arrives on how it can be done - the SEI goes and does it. But “on single breath of inspiration” it is possible to do only a small volume of work, so how do representatives of this type do write multi-volume novels and direct so many films?</p>
<p>The ISFps works magnificently well in creative sense. The SEI starts work on inspiration, and later forces him or herself to continue with it and to finish it. (Many artistic works of people of this type, the very beginning of the work - be it book, film, or opera - appears much more talented, more promising, and more interesting than its continuation and its end.) Between the first half of work and following parts there sometimes can be wide intervals of time. The SEI must “ripen” to continue with it and to complete it. This is very important for him - then the result justifies itself.</p>
<p>The ISFp does not like to show unfinished work. The ISFp also dislikes it when someone else is controlling his process of work. He does not like it when in the process of work someone begins to criticize it, even if constructively - criticizing his methods, his concept, or his style. In SEI’s understanding this means to create obstacles in his way. In such cases the SEI usually demands that he’s allowed to finish working independently, without any intrusions, and to present the final result.</p>
<p>The ISFp tries to select such a profession that would completely realize his creative potential, but if this didn’t happen, then he tries to find work that would match his skills and possibilities. In such cases, the SEI does not lay claim to a bright professional career and tries not to stand out in anything, so that he’s not scolded or praised too much. He tries not to catch the eye and attention of the management and does not take on any excessive workloads, initiatives, responsibilities, or duties.</p>
<p>Impression is sometimes created that the ISFp generally fears work and searches for ways to evade it. If someone introduces some new problems into his work and by this complicates it, the SEI feels terribly annoyed. For example, if for training or systematic purposes, the ISFp is forced to solve a simple problem by complex methods (as is sometimes required in procedures of ESTjs), this literally makes him irate and makes him lose composure. The ISFp needs someone to show him the simplest and most sensible procedure or methodology, that would require the minimum expenditure of time and effort, and complicating it he can do by himself.</p>
<p>The ISFp reads the instructions very attentively and very carefully. The SEI is highly attentive to all methodological and systematic recommendations. The study notebooks of SEI, as a rule, are the most complete and most accurate ones in class. The SEI is that student who is always asking others for their notes. If other students refuse him in this, he immediately looks very unhappy, because this is actually very important for him.</p>
<p>To independently figure out some procedure, and then to use it rationally and effectively, is a genuine victory for the ISFp. The SEI feels happy when others turn to him for council or consultation about some familiar to him procedure. Sometimes it even seems to the SEI that methodological consultations - are his vocation.</p>
<p>The ISFp fairly often contemplates how he or she can earn well. Although it is precisely earning money that is extremely difficult for the SEI. Even being the a highly skilled and educated specialist, the SEI can intensively search for work for several months, and then agree to work under unfavorable conditions: “Yes, it’s possible to work for free to at least get a recommendation and improve one’s qualification.”</p>
<p>For the ISFp it is very important to find work in a growing, constantly in demand field, so that in future it won’t be necessary to change professions, and so that there won’t be complications with searching for work. (Aspect of “logic of actions”, Te, for SEIs is connected with the aspects of “intuition of time”, Ni, and “intuition of possibilities”, Ne.) Therefore, in questions and issues of work and business, for ISFp it is most convenient to receive advice and forecasts of his dual, ILE “Don Quixote”, for whom these aspects are located in strong demonstrative positions; therefore the ILE can allow himself to be lenient to the insufficient practicalness of his partner.</p>
<p>Dualized ISFp usually very highly evaluates and values business qualities of his dual partner and agrees with many of his proposals: “The very first year of our marriage my husband said we need to go into a regime of extreme saving. We denied absolutely everything to ourselves for the entire year. But the following year we immediately got a car. My husband got a full-time position at work and now they are going to make him a companion of firm, and from there it will be possible to buy a house … “</p>
<p>The ISFp knows how to live in the regime of extreme savings, especially if it’s a temporary phenomenon, if there is a light showing at the end of this tunnel, and finally, and most importantly, if this is required in the interests of his family and his loved ones. Subconsciously, the ISFp is always confident of the intuition of his partner, since the SEI is oriented at strong intuition of his dual. The ISFp thus knows and always counts on the fact that the way out of a difficult situation will be found, moreover, in the shortest time possible. This state of things usually calms the SEI and then he or she with pleasure takes up immediate matters - economically taking care of family’s business, household, and other matters. In this the ISFp has no equals, since, as it is known, only the ISFp can from from one hen make five substantial dishes (“broth, fried legs, jello, salad, and also stuffed neck”) and feed his numerous family with them. However it might seem that the ISFp is scared of work, nevertheless, he/she is a very industrious person. Working according to his vocation under favorable conditions, the ISFp always shows brilliant results. Being occupied by favorite work, the ISFp is frequently beyond any competition. Work for ISFps - is always a very substantial and serious responsibility, and although the SEI sometimes makes the impression of being a “talented slacker”, in reality - often this is a talented worker.</p>

<h3>5th Function - Ne Extraverted intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#th-function-ne-extraverted-intuition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In everything that concerns searching for possibilities, the ISFp acts with little confidence. The SEI is as if always searching for support and help from the side, constantly looking for some mentor, adviser, or teacher, who will give him some advice on whether he’s acting correctly.</p>
<p>The ISFp is inclined to understate his own possibilities - they frequently seem to him to be insufficient for resolving his vital problems. For example, he may frequently regret that he doesn’t have influential connections, that almost no one helps him, that he has no one that he could confer with, no one to turn to, not on to lean on.</p>
<p>The ISFp tries to be farsighted and prudent, but since to independently account for all of the possibilities and potential of a situation is very difficult for him, he frequently makes mistakes, which sometimes turn into serious problems. For example, the ISFp cannot always assess the overall, general nature of a situation, which sometimes leads to his cordiality and friendliness getting taken advantage of and his trust being let down. Knowing this, the ISFp tries to be more careful and more farsighted, but nevertheless he frequently makes it possible to bring himself to frankness, about which subsequently he may greatly regret. Therefore, the ISFp always listens with interest to recommendations about what benefits he can extract for himself from this or some another situation, how it’s better to act in this or another case, and what could be the potential consequences or results of his actions. On his own, the ISFp struggles with answering such questions. He has little confidence in his own estimates and forecasts and often doubts them, even if he may voice them in a confident tone.</p>
<p>Situation radically changes when ISFp acquires such a partner as his dual the ENTp. With all his seeming detachment from the realities of life, the ENTp knows how to sensibly evaluate the possibilities and potential of a situation, as well as the capabilities of his partner. ENTp’s analysis of any situation is meant exactly for giving the actions of his partner the necessary sensible direction.</p>
<p>The most complete information on the aspect of “intuition of possibilities” the ENTp provides precisely to his dual, the ISFp. With the partners of types, pleasant and productive contact and conversations on this theme, as a rule, do not happen or happen with subpar results.</p>
<p>Around an ENTp, the ISFp feels himself reliably protected and safeguarded, capable of surviving and withstanding the most difficult life conditions: “When my husband and I moved here, we were completely alone, no one helped us. Here we had no family, no relatives or friends. We achieved everything by our own efforts … “</p>
<p>As has been already mentioned, the ISFp prefers to look at life realistically; therefore it is very important to him to be confident of realization of his possibilities and potential. The ISFp considers that the earlier a person can find his calling, the easier it will be to realize oneself.</p>
<p>Dualized ISFp works creatively in more interesting ways. It is exactly in the partnership with his dual, ENTp, that the ISFp finally gets an opportunity to limitlessly develop his fantasy and to acts as a bright innovator in a chosen field of application. To confidently determine new directions in art and movies, to become creator of new styles and genres.</p>
<p>On development of talents of his children, the ISFp does not spare efforts nor money. The ISFp is always inclined to see in his or her child a winning lottery ticket, which may sometimes win. Frequently, through the abilities of own children the ISFp attempts to realize his or her own unrealized talents and possibilities.</p>
<p>The development of his own talents for the ISFp has great significance. For this very reason the SEI is greatly interested in opinions of his own professional potential, of the opportunities and possibilities that are available to him, and evaluations of his own capabilities and potential. The ISFp dislikes is when his or her abilities are being criticizes.</p>
<p>People who can find and open up his own talents evoke much interest from the ISFp. The ISFp loves to listen to about bright future prospects and interesting events that he may still expect further in life. He may, for example, at an old age try to fulfill a long-time dream and master some profession, which earlier for some reasons he considered to be out of reach.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="th-function-ti-ti-introverted-logic">
<h3>6th Function - Ti Ti Introverted logic<a class="headerlink" href="#th-function-ti-ti-introverted-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ISFp with pleasure takes up work that to him seems logically sound and logically specific, for which he/she has sufficient theoretical preparation and understanding.</p>
<p>The credibility of sources of information is very important for the ISFp. For example, if some logical discrepancy is found in a source the ISFp used as a reference, the ISFp won’t calm down until he finds some explanation for this, or until he figures out how important and fundamental this illogicality is, how it will influence the general course and essence of his work.</p>
<p>If the ISFp has some doubts about the accuracy and authenticity of the information, he will prepare the theoretical material for himself, independently, and spend both time and money on this. For example, one student of this type purchased an electronic translator for herself which she used to translate all of the necessary information that was published in a foreign language instead of using already translated versions which she found to be inaccurate.</p>
<p>The ISFp scrupulously gathers all the material and information which he considers to be important to himself, thoroughly analyzes it, thinks it over. The ISFp is exceptionally observant of details and minor facts. “I immediately suspected something is wrong when my husband sat down to read the newspaper and immediately threw it aside. This has never happened before! That he would put down the newspaper and didn’t read it cover to cover.”</p>
<p>Exceptional power of observation and the ability to deeply analyze obtained information make it possible for ISFps to show themselves magnificently well in many professional fields. (For example, they may succeed in such professions as intelligence officer, inspector, doctor, actor, movie director, and so on.)</p>
<p>The ISFp is greatly interested in the most promising scientific methods. He tries to be up to date with the latest developments, renovates his computer with the newest programs and updates.</p>
<p>The ISFp can be convinced only by credible, reliable facts and by logically sequential and coherent arguments. It is also interesting for the SEI to unearth and observe some logical regularities or laws in some difficult to explain phenomena.</p>
<p>Luckily for the ISFp they have such a dual as the ENTp who is capable of calculating and thinking up that which still does not exist nature, the most daring fantasy, the most daring concept. Based on calculations and the logical computations of the ENTp the most daring dream seems to be close and easily obtainable in reality, and the ISFp (with his entire sober realism) with pleasure participates in the most fantastical projects of the ENTp, with readiness offering his help and support in the realization of his dual’s most daring undertakings.</p>

<h3>7th Function - Se Extraverted sensing<a class="headerlink" href="#th-function-se-extraverted-sensing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ISFp speaks of his volitional qualities approximately in this way: “I only recently understood that I do have, as it turns out, a large force of will”.</p>
<p>The force of will that SEI possesses is actually significant, but he does not allow himself to use it without a particular necessity. Therefore, he frequently makes an impression of a soft and relaxed person, who tries to be very accurate and delicate in the methods of volitional action. This is explained by the fact that volitional sensing of SEI is subconsciously oriented at the weak and sensitive volitional sensing of ILE. Therefore the SEI tries not to exert open volitional pressure on anyone. (Subconsciously, the SEI holds his powers in reserve as an extreme measure for extreme and critical situations.)</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Translator’s note: In sports and martial arts classes types with strong Si and subconscious Se are characterized by smoother, as if rounded movements that don’t impart much of a sudden impact. In combat Si dominant types may prefer to ‘tank’ ie absorb the attack of the other person thereby wearing them out before they go into attack mode themselves.</p>
</div>
<p>If the situation requires it, the ISFp can be firm and upfront, but nevertheless he never uses his volitional qualities in excess. The ISFp does not like to work in positions that require him to demand strict and unquestioned obedience. The ISFp usually makes for a “soft” and sincere leader, even at highest levels of management. (SEI actors when playing roles of cruel leaders or monarchs, as a rule, do not mobilize their volitional sensing - they play them as being outwardly soft and sincere, but internally strict, firm, and determined, i.e. they play themselves.)</p>
<p>The ISFp shows harshness only in cases when his “soft” approach brings no positive results. If, for example, his request was met by a refusal, the ISFp creates a situation of the completely intolerable stress and pressure, and this, as a rule, costs him a lot of his strengths. (And to bring himself to excessive stress the ISFp generally dislikes; he prefers to save his forces and use them only economically.)</p>
<p>The ISFp greatly dislikes having to resort to methods of volitional action. To him it’s unpleasant to even fall into such a situation, which would force him to this: it’s unpleasant for him to reproach, unpleasant to exact vengeance. Subconsiously being oriented at weak sensing and ethical functions of his ENTp dual, the ISFp understands that such actions are permissible only in the very extreme cases, when his requests are constantly being ignored, when his interests are absolutely not taken into consideration, when his sacrifices are not noted or valued by anyone - then the ISFp begins to regret that he spent all his efforts for nothing and he begins to demonstratively ignore the interests of his partner, thereby taking revenge (but this the most extreme measure!).</p>
<p>Under normal cicrumstances, the ISFp is not inclined to punish nor force anyone. He tries to achieve everything “in an amicable way”, by means of persuasion and conversation.</p>
<p>The ISFp does not like scandals. He/she prefers to discuss problems and issues calmly, without negative emotions, and only on a foundation of facts.</p>
<p>In contact with other people, the ISFp tries not to use harsh ethical measures: it is unpleasant for him to quarrel, unpleasant to have to reject someone or turn them down. It is even uncomfortable for the ISFp to put an end to an undesirable acquaintance, date, or meeting. Therefore, the ISFp is wary of unceremonious and self-imposing people. (The need to maintain contacts in which he’s not interested is sometimes perceived by him as a serious problem.)</p>
<p>The ISFp is also incapable of building himself a career by methods of volitional pressure. He achieves anything only by means of his own talents, patience, and skill to create personal contacts. Neither with his forehead nor elbows can he work.</p>
<p>The ISFp tries to avoid conditions and occupations that involve cut-throat competition. He does not intend to fight for authority or influence - these are not his values. However, the ISFp also won’t allow anyone to put himself in a dead-end hopeless situation. He won’t allow anyone to deprive him of the right to choose, or to encroach on his personal freedom. He won’t allow this even to his dual, ILE “Don Quixote”, who sometimes gets carried away on the aspect of volitional sensing so much, that he begins to play the role of a tyrant and despot. In such cases, the ISFp immediately attempts to logically and ethically get to the cause and the reasons for this behavior. He tries to remove these causes and reasons, to calm his dual down, and to logically persuade him. The ISFp has to use the entire extent of his endurance and willpower so that under any conditions, in most critical and most extreme situations, he may preserve emphatically good relations with his partner. Though this is already a topic for the description of the next function of ISFp.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="th-function-fi-introverted-ethics">
<h3>8th Function - Fi Introverted ethics<a class="headerlink" href="#th-function-fi-introverted-ethics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ISFp strives for personal harmony in all of his relations. For the ISFp it is characteristic to join an already prevailing system of relations and there select for himself a convenient position, which corresponds to his own values, views, and prevailing circumstances.</p>
<p>Most comfortably the ISFp feels himself in the conditions of initially well-wishing relations that have quickly come together in circumstances of close distance. (These are the only positive qualities of ENTp’s problematic function of “ethics of relations”, Fi - initial rosy outlook on people and good-will, and rapid decrease of interpersonal distance.) Finding himself in a situation of pleasant and benevolent relations, the ISFp tries to not disrupt by anything the prevailing interpersonal harmony, and instead to contribute to the general emotional flow his own efforts.</p>
<p>Good relation towards himself the ISFp receives with deep gratitude: “I was so moved by his gift, that I cried as I was walking home … simply out of gratitude to this person!”</p>
<p>The ISFp greatly values good, positive relations, and tries to do everything in his power to strengthen such ties. Therefore, his own positive considerations of someone sometimes take on exaggerated and demonstratively expressive forms.</p>
<p>How the ISFp relates - is always a bright and demonstrative reaction to how those around him relate to him. If there is some misunderstanding, the ISFp starts being demonstratively offended. However, in the interests of favorable development of relations with his partner, the ISFp forces himself to not “to get stuck” on hurts and offences, since this leads to rather serious ethical complications, which he himself will then have to resolve and straighten out, which will present certain difficulties to himself primarily.</p>
<p>The aspect of the ethics of relations for ISFp is located not on the most advantageous positions; therefore the ISFp does everything possible to keep positive, level relations with his partner and in no shape or form lead matters to a conflict. The ISFp thus tries to support any positive impulse that comes from his partner, and uses any possibility to give vividly and demonstratively expressed positive tone and direction to his relationship with his partner.</p>
<p>This is explained by the fact that the ISFp is subconsiously oriented at weak and vulnerable ethics of his dual, ENTp, for whom it’s very important that his good relation would immediately find a response from his partner. If the ENTp does not see a clearly expressed reaction to his ethical actions, he begins to feel nervous and tries to provoke his partner to sort out relations, until he is certain that his partner actually relates to him well.</p>
<p>If relations are expressed insufficiently demonstratively, the ENTp simply does not believe in them. Demonstratively expressed ethical functions of the ISFp frees the ENTp from the need to arrange tests to test the feelings of his partner. (For example: An ENTp to whom the feelings of his wife seemed insufficiently clearly expressed, once stole and hid their own son in order to check whether she is capable of being a “real mother”.)</p>
<p>If the ISFp, as a consequence of own upbringing and training, has trouble openly demonstrating his feelings, if to him this seems to be improper, that his relationships is still insufficiently clear, that he still has to pose or play, then he has most serious problems with his dual. For ENTp, in view of his vulnerable ethics, it is necessary to feel and become convinced, as soon as possible, that next to him is a loving and devoted friend.</p>
<p>Protecting the interests of a close and dear person, the ISFp with pleasure assumes the function of a diplomat. The ISFp masterfully well uses his skills to establish contacts with the people, and is capable of sufficiently quickly reconciling his dual with people around him. The ENTp, in turn, notices it and receives this with appreciation. In the presence of the ISFp, the ENTp always feels himself considerably more confident, in at least because it feels himself ethically protected.</p>
<p>Without any special for his efforts, the ISFp calms down the ENTp, smoothing out his ethical awkwardness and misunderstandings, turning his attention to some neutral and distant topics. In case of ethical mistakes and awkwardness, the ISFp draw the attention of the public away and distracts them. Moreover, he does all of this easily and naturally, thereby creating for his dual a convenient psychological atmosphere for communication and social contacts, helps him to feel comfortable and secure, and to enjoy himself.</p>
<p>Demonstrative friendliness and good-will of ISFps - is an indispensable condition of their sensory harmony, the basic prerequisite of their sensory program.</p>
