.. _EII-Meged:

EII (Dostoevsky)
---------------------------------------------

**EII, INFj (Ethical-Intuitive Introvert): HUMANITARIAN** 

**Appearance**: EII's gaze is often attentive, analyzing, astute and discerning, but soft. Sometimes it seems a little detached and scattered, other times studying the person before him, shy and embarrassed. Now and then EII's gaze expresses a silent reproach as a consequence of his concealed and unexpressed thoughts or impressions. His eyes are very expressive and easily convey feelings of sympathy or offense; then they convey hidden pain and melancholy, much more rarely happiness. The mimicry of his face, conversely, is very limited. Most often EII's face seems inspirited, calm and impassive, and a little tense. He smiles rarely; his smile seems shy and discreet. EII's poses and gestures are undemonstrative. He is usually a little bit restrained in conversation. The tone of his voice is muted, even his exclamations don't seem loud. He's rarely verbose and grandiloquent, but only in cases when he has to defend his opinions and principles. EII doesn't always enter an argument, nevertheless, he is very stubborn and set in his convictions.

**Character**: EII's main characteristics are attentiveness to people and a dose of humanism. He is diligent and punctual, thorough and detailed in any undertaking or assignment. Dislikes the rush, thus prepares in advance. Knows how to allocate tasks and events in time, and complete them by the deadline. Shows empathy and active kindness towards people who are close to him. Though his dedication often gets taken advantage of, as it is difficult for him to turn a person down. A little unsure of himself, not showy. Has a negative attitude towards violence and authoritarianism, opposing them with quiet stubbornness and endurance. Avoiding disputes can give way, but does not change their beliefs. Do not forgive injustice and betrayal, uncompromising in matters of morality and ethics. In other matters compliant and tolerant. He prefers to hide his emotions, even-tempered and restrained in a relationship. Revelation only with loved ones. Impressionable and vulnerable, hard to tolerate argument, she tries to reconcile the warring parties, but to be objective. Poor suffers alone, but their society does not impose.
